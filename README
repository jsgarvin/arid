== Assumptions
The plugin makes certain assumptions about your application.
Some of these can be bypassed or overridden if your app does
not conform.

* You have appropriate map.resources lines in your routes.rb
  for any controllers you intend to test with these methods.
* sessions_path helper method returns the path to a controller
  that controls user logins. (Provided automatically by
  Rails if you have a sessions_controller and routes.rb
  includes "map.resources :sessions".) 
* Your sessions controller accepts parameters in the form of...
  {:user => {:username => 'xxx', :password => 'yyy'}} Override
  by providing your own new_session_as method that generates
  an appropriate session for your app with the user provided.
